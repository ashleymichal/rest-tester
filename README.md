#### Warmup: Sending Params with RestClient

###### From The Odin Project

In this project, you'll get a chance to interact with a Rails application from the command line by sending requests manually. You'll first build a very simple app (to get some practice with the steps involved in creating a new one) and then a simple script which uses the RestClient gem (which you used in the first project) to send some requests and examine the server output.
